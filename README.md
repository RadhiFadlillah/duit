Duit is a simple money tracker written in Go language and Mithril.js. I created this for me and my wife, so the feature is a bit lacking, just the bare needed features to track where the money goes. However, I hope it will be useful for other families as well. This application is distributed as a single binary, which means it can be installed and used easily.

## Features

- Basic money tracking, i.e. income, expense and transfer.

- Simple chart to track total money available.
